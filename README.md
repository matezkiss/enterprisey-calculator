This is a half-ready calculator, some parts are not implemented and it may not be bug-free.
The goal is to finish the program and test all parts of the program.

Please do the following tasks:
- Create well-understandable git commits when logically related steps are ready
- "Turn on" the implemented but not yet used functions (like sub, div, mul)
- Extend the existing unit tests with missing use-cases
- Write new unit tests if required
- Write E2E tests: test the entire operation of the program (calling the Main.main())
- If there is any bug in functionality, fix them
- Make sure the program runs without crashes, all possible errors are handled user-friendly way
- If there is any other problem with the code (code organization or others), fix them
- Add SUM function to the program without breaking the existing functionalities:
  - SUM can receive numbers after the operation, like SUM 1 2 3 4 ...  and calculate the result (sum=10 in this example)
  - add unit test and E2E test
- Send the whole project back to us as a zip/tar.gz file
